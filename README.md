# ML-Scikit-PySpark-Examples Repository

## About
Explore machine learning examples using both scikit-learn and PySpark. This repository contains code samples demonstrating machine learning tasks on different datasets. You'll find examples for running machine learning tasks locally with scikit-learn and performing distributed machine learning using PySpark with datasets stored in HDFS.

## Contents
- **Scikit-Learn Example:** Code demonstrating machine learning using scikit-learn with a local dataset.
- **PySpark Example:** Code showcasing distributed machine learning using PySpark on HDFS-stored datasets.

## Usage
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Navigate to the relevant directory (scikit-learn or PySpark).
3. Follow the instructions in the code files to run the examples.

## Contribute
Contributions are appreciated! Feel free to contribute new examples, enhancements, or bug fixes through [pull requests](https://github.com/barkaat-ali/LocalVsHDFS-ML-Demos).
